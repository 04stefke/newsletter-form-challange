## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to mix colors using linear-gradient, and found out a nice mixing colors(pink and orange). I have used flex-direction: reverse-column; for the first time, this is a life changer to be honest...

### Continued development

I will make a full blog application, which would have few things like this project.
